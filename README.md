### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Nika, a passionate full stack developer. I am currently based in Tel Aviv, Israel. 

My primary interest is UI development â€” I love making stuff more accessible, easier and more pleasant to use. I take great care in the everything that I build.

Before web development, I used to work in academia. There I learned Python, analysed data, wrote reports and published scientific articles.

My pet project is DM Haven â€” an app for playing Dungeons and Dragons. It mostly works as a wiki of all items and monsters, but I am working on adding auth & web sockets to create rooms, where you can show maps, rolls dice and narrate the story. 

**Languages and tools:**  

TypeScript, React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, CSS-in-JS, Angular, Akita, RxJS
